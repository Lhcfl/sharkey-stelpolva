  Sharkey Stelpolva Edition adds additional keyword syntax to the antenna settings.
  That means, the special keyword `domain:example.com` will match all posts from `example.com`. This keyword can also be used in OR syntax.
  Specifically, you must use `domain:here` to match posts in this instance.
stpvPgroongaSearchInstru: Use the `A OR B` syntax to search for notes containing either A or B. `A B` (with a space in between) means posts containing both keywords A and B.
